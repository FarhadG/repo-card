{"name":"Repo Card","tagline":":scroll: Give your repos some freshness with a Repo Card","body":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://farhadg.github.io/repo-card/\">Repo Card</a>\r\n===========================================================================\r\n\r\nGive your repos some freshness with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://farhadg.github.io/repo-card/\">Repo Card</a>.\r\n\r\nI often get lazy adding a profile to my repositories, especially when I'd like for them to get forked, starred, etc. \r\nIf you've been there, then Repo Cards are for you.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nHere's one of my own repos with one: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://farhadg.github.io/2048-cube/dist/\">2048 Cube</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://farhadg.github.io/2048-cube/dist/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/x3tu6g.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"2048 Cube\"></a>\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou can add a repo card in many different ways. Choose one that's easiest for you:\r\n\r\nReference the script file via the CDN (not fast, yet)\r\n```javascript\r\n<script src=\"https://rawgit.com/FarhadG/repo-card/master/repo-card.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall via Bower\r\n```bash\r\n$ bower install repo-card --save\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, you simply configure the Repo card with your info\r\n```javascript\r\n// Once sourced from either a CDN or locally, you use the data-attributes to configure the repo card\r\n<script src=\"./repo-card.min.js\" id=\"repo-card-lib\"\r\n        data-repo=\"init\"\r\n        data-username=\"farhadg\"\r\n        data-title=\"Init\">\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, you configure it within your app as seen in the `script` tag below\r\n```javascript\r\n<script src=\"../lib/repo-card/repo-card.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\n  RepoCard\r\n    .configure({\r\n      repo: 'init',\r\n      username: 'farhadg',\r\n      title: 'Init',\r\n      subtitle: '@farhadg',\r\n      info: 'A quick way to get you to the first commit of any GitHub repo (tracks branches too)',\r\n      position: {\r\n        top: 25\r\n        right: 25\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nHere are some options that you can set within the `data-attrbutes` (e.g. `data-info=\"some information`) or in your app.\r\n\r\n- `repo`: The name of the repo \r\n- `theme`: There's only one theme right now (`doodle`), however, I'd love more themes. Check out the `themes` folder or reach out if you'd like assistance in contributing\r\n- `username`: Your Github username\r\n- `title`: A title for the repo card\r\n- `subtitle`: A subtitle for the repo card\r\n- `info`: Some information you'd like to include about your project\r\n- `background`: Set the background (it accepts CSS, so HEX, RGB or even an image, `url(...)`, works\r\n- `thumb`: Set the thumbnail (it accepts CSS, so HEX, RGB or even an image, `url(...)`, works\r\n- `position`: The card is currently set to `fixed` position, so you can change its position (e.g. `position: { bottom: 15, left: 15 }`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Coming\r\n\r\n- More themes (would love your help on this)\r\n- GUI dashboard for configuring the Repo Card\r\n- Animations to have the repo card hide away with interactions (e.g. `scroll`)\r\n- NPM, Browserify, Webpack, etc. builds?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nPlease use the issues page with any questions/concerns. If you like this idea and find it useful, please share the project as I'd love the help :) ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
